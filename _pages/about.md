I'm a health economist currently completing a PhD at the University of Manchester, funded by the Psoriasis Association. My research evaluates the cost-effectiveness of systemic therapies for psoriasis, with the aim of optimising treatment sequences to improve outcomes for patients and support efficient use of healthcare resources.

My work spans economic modelling, evidence synthesis, and real world evidence analysis. I have experience developing, interpreting, and communicating health economic analyses across roles in both academia and consulting.
